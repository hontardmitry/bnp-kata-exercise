# API Test Automation Framework

This project is a basic API Test Automation Framework built using Java, Rest Assured, and Cucumber. It targets sample endpoints of a dummy API service and demonstrates key principles of structured, maintainable, and scalable API test automation.

The purpose of this framework is to showcase core skills in designing and implementing automated API tests. It is not intended to provide full test coverage or include exhaustive validation checks. Instead, it focuses on demonstrating the ability to work with test automation tools and provide solutions for a specified API

## ðŸ“š Useful Commands
| Maven Command         | Description                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| `mvn clean test`      | Run all Cucumber tests          |
| `mvn verify`          | Run tests and verify lifecycle  |
| `mvn dependency:tree` | View dependency hierarchy       |

**CLI run**
To run tests from the command line, execute the following command:

```mvn exec:java                                  ^
    -Dexec.classpathScope=test                 ^
    -Dexec.mainClass=io.cucumber.core.cli.Main ^
    -Dexec.args="--glue com.dmytrohont.test --tags @Smoke"
   ```
This command will run all Cucumber tests with the `@Smoke` tag, using the `com.dmytrohont.test` package as the glue code.
